Calvin Pop Machine Project
==========================
See INSTALL for how to set the system up.

There are several subprograms, each with a specific task:
  -dex_communicate: pull data from the pop machine using a serial interface.
  -dex_parser: turn the DEX output from dexComm into a text file, HTML, or XML.
  -xmltodb: input the interesting fields from an XML file generated by pop_parser into a SQLite database
  -web_interface: CGI script to output information from the database as a web page.

dex_communicate and dex_parser are written in C, and the rest is in Python.

glue/pop_machine.sh strings together the components to pull data from the pop machine and put it
 into the database that the web interface uses.

V 1.0 was written by John Kloosterman <john.kloosterman@gmail.com> as an honours project
 for CS 232 (Operating Systems). We've re-compiled much of the code to run on ARM and updated the server stack and interfaces.
