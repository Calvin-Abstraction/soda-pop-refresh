parsexml.py puts the interesting data from XML files generated by dex_parser into a database
for the website.
-The path to the database file is in settings.py.
-Before running parsexml.py, run createdb.py to create the tables in the database 
  and add friendly names for the products in our machine.

Database design:
=============
table products:
	unix_time - the time the data was input, *not* when the data was read from the machine.
			The machine time is too unreliable to use.
	product_id - button number on physical machine
	item_price - current price in dollars
	num_vended - number vended since machine initialization

table temperature
	unix_time
	temp - temperature in degrees @unit.
	unit - temperature scale unit.

table names
	product_id - Machine product ID
	name - Human-friendly name for @product_id
