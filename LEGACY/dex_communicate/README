This is a linux port of the program in
	specifications/Dexread Version 1.1.zip

It will communicate using the DEX protocol with a pop machine on the other side of
 DEVICE (defined in linux_io.c as "/dev/ttyS0") and spit out the raw data from the
 machine.

It takes ~5 seconds to get the data.

If there is no pop machine connected, then it will retry MAX_TRIES times
 (defined in dex.c) before giving up and exiting with a non-zero exit status.
