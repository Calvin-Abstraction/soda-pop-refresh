This program needs to be running anytime the cable is connected and
the pop-machine user interface needs to be running (i.e. whenever
we aren't pulling data.

I think it works because the pop machine tests to see if the cable is
connected by trying to pull the computer(TX) -> machine(RX) line to 0,
so if we set it to 0, the pop machine thinks it was the cause and thinks
there is no cable connected.

Send it SIGUSR1 to tell it to gracefully shut down.
