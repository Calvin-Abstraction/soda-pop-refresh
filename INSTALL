Steps to install pop machine interface and CGI script
=====================================================

(0) Expand tarball or pull from repository into a directory.
(1) Compile by calling make in the project root.
(2) Modify glue/pop_machine.sh and glue/trick_popmachine.sh to reflect installation directory and desired log directory.
(3) Set glue/pop_machine.sh to run as a cron job every so often, probably once every hour.
(4) Modify web_interface/popmachine.py, xmltodb/settings.py to reflect where the database will go.
(5) Install web_interface/popmachine.py into web server CGI directory.
(6) Create database with xmltodb/createdb.py
(7) Set glue/trick_popmachine to run at boot.
(8) Restart or start trick_popmachine manually.

Where there are hardcoded paths/settings:
=========================================
* glue/pop_machine.sh - binary and logfile directories
* web_interface/popmachine.py, xmltodb/settings.py - database path
* xmltodb/createdb.py - Human names for pop machine product numbers
