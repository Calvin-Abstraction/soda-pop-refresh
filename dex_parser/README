dex_parser parses the DEX files ouput by dex_communicate into better
 formats.

The format is elucidated in:
  specifications/evadts_6-1.zip/EVADTS_6-1/EVADTS<date>.pdf, pg. 24-27,
   with reference to Appendix A for more details.

Most lines are parsed; the few types left out aren't interesting enough
 to us to use.

Note that lines beginning with MA5 are manufacturer-defined and I
 only interpreted the lines I could guess the meaning of.

You will need bison and flex to compile this.
